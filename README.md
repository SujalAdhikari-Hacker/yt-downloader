# YouTubeDownloader

> **My personal Windows app** for downloading YouTube videos and audio, built entirely in Python using Flet and yt-dlp, then packaged into a single `.exe` with PyInstaller.

---

## üöÄ About This Project

I created **YouTubeDownloader** to have a simple, no-fuss desktop tool:

* Intuitive GUI: paste URL, pick folder, choose resolution & format.
* Supports resolutions up to 4K, with automatic audio merging and re-encoding.
* Export to MP4, MP3, or both in one click.
* Packaged as a **standalone EXE**‚Äîno Python install required.

This is my fully open-source side project; feel free to explore or tweak how I did it.

## üîß Quick Start

### üì¶ Run the EXE (zero setup)

1. Download **YouTubeDownloader.exe** from the [`dist/`](dist/) folder.
2. Double-click and the GUI launches immediately.
3. Paste a YouTube link, select your folder, choose resolution/format, and click **Download**.

### üêç Run from Source (for tinkers)

```bash
# Clone or download this repo
cd YT_DOWNLOADER

# Install dependencies (Python 3.7+ required)
pip install yt-dlp flet
# Ensure ffmpeg.exe sits alongside download_app.py or is on your PATH

# Start the app
git download_app.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Packaged the EXE

I use **PyInstaller** to bundle everything into one file:

```bash
# Clean old builds
del YouTubeDownloader.spec
rmdir /S /Q build dist

# Create the EXE
py -3 -m PyInstaller --clean \
  --onefile \
  --windowed \
  --name YouTubeDownloader \
  --add-binary "ffmpeg.exe;." \
  download_app.py
```

This embeds Python, Flet, yt-dlp, and FFmpeg so you don‚Äôt need any external installs.
